You can easily customize the animation with the following self-descriptive properties:

- `lineWidth`: This property controls the width of the circular stroke path
- `strokeStartDuration`: Duration for stroke start animation
- `strokeEndDuration`: Duration for stroke end animation
- `spinDuration`: Rotating duration for 2pi
- `shouldAutoReverseAnimation`: Indicates whether the animation should be reversed
- `lineDash`: The pattern used to draw the line
- `colors`: The colors to add to the indicator

Initialize the indicator like this or any other way you want
```swift
lazy var activityIndicator: KDCircularActivityIndicator = {
        let indicator = KDCircularActivityIndicator()
        indicator.colors = [.red, .blue]
        indicator.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        return indicator
    }()
```

Call startAnimating() to you know what 
```swift
activityIndicator.startAnimating()
```

Call stopAnimating() to you also know what 
```swift
activityIndicator.stopAnimating()
```

## Author

This framework was written by Kauna Mohammed. 

## Inspiration
KDCircularActivityIndicator was inspired by an Objective-C framework - [DTCircularActivityIndicator][dtcircularActivityIndicator-objc-url].

The API of KDCircularActivityIndicator has been designed to be as close as possible to DTCircularActivityIndicator for consistency and it's also designed with a swifty feeling ‚úåüèø. Check out [DTCircularActivityIndicator][dtcircularActivityIndicator-objc-url] if you want a framework with the same functionality in Objective-C.
